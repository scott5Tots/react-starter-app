# Overview
This repository is designed to complement the "nodejs-starter-app" repository and is **not** intended to be a substitute. Prior to engaging with this material, students should ensure they have completed up to Step 5 of the aforementioned Node.js guide. Additionally, this repository does not provide a comprehensive tutorial on React â€“ though we will offer some tips and best practices. A foundational understanding of JavaScript is expected, and our focus will be on setting up a connection between the node/express/SQL server (backend) and the React app (client).
## Prerequisites
Students should have experience with the following:
- JavaScript
- Routes
- Models
- Controllers
- CRUD methods
- React
## Contributions 
This project is the result of collaborative efforts from Michael and Aline, from Oregon State University, and Nicole from Immaculata University.
## Terminal Application 
All steps and instructions in this guide are performed using the VS Code terminal. It's assumed that students have already been introduced/are confortable with bash commands.
## Inspiration
While this guide primarily focuses on the technical aspect of integrating a React application with our school's servers and SQL databases, it's important to acknowledge the broader creative aspect that React opens up for developers. Unlike the more rigid structures often encountered in plain Node.js, HTML, and CSS, React's extensive library ecosystem allow for unparalleled flexibility and dynamism in design.

React's component-based architecture not only makes our code more reusable and manageable but also allows us to experiment with a wide range of design patterns and user interfaces. The ability to encapsulate UI logic and state in components paves the way for more interactive and responsive applications, aligning perfectly with modern web development trends. <br><br>
Here is what my partner and I developed for our final project. This project not only challenged us technically but also allowed us to explore our creative capacities in web design and user experience.<br><br>
