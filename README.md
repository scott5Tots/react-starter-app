# Overview
This repository serves as a starting point for setting up a web server with the following components:

- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server.
- Express: A fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
## Prerequisites
Students are expeceted to have followed the node.js starter app [repo](https://github.com/osu-cs340-ecampus/nodejs-starter-app/tree/main).
  Students should have experience with the following:
- Routes
- Models
- Controllers
## Contributions 
This project is the result of collaborative efforts from Michael and Aline, from Oregon State University (OSU), and Nicole from Immaculata University.
## Terminal Application 
## Inspiration
While this guide primarily focuses on the technical intricacies of integrating a React application with our school's servers and SQL databases, it's important to acknowledge the broader creative horizon that React opens up for developers. Unlike the more rigid structures often encountered in plain Node.js, HTML, and CSS, React's extensive library ecosystem empowers us with unparalleled flexibility and dynamism in design.

React's component-based architecture not only makes our code more reusable and manageable but also allows us to experiment with a wide range of design patterns and user interfaces. The ability to encapsulate UI logic and state in components paves the way for more interactive and responsive applications, aligning perfectly with modern web development trends. <br><br>
Here is what my partner and I developed for our final project. This project not only challenged us technically but also allowed us to explore our creative capacities in web design and user experience.<br><br>
