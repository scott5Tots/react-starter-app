The React app is made up of different parts. 
* Components
* Pages
* Main App.js <br>
___
Components are independent and reusable files that work ‘isolated’ from the main app. In this project, our components tell our app how to get/put/post/delete data from our backend server. Components are also useful if you want to add a nav bar and modals. <br>
Pages folder defines how each page (ex. http://flip3.engr.oregonstate.edu:5547/players) is structured. App.js is our main page (http://flip3.engr.oregonstate.edu:5547/)
