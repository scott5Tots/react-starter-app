# Debugging

Knowing how to properly test and debug your application is just as critical as your coding prowess. <br>
While console logs can be very helpful, they are often time consuming due to repetition and are limited in scope when it comes to your backend. Postman is a free software app that allows developers to test http methods on databases. It is a great tool to test whether your backend or frontend is the one causing trouble. <br>
If the tests come out as expected on Postman, then the problem is most likely related to something in your frontend (wrong call, faulty logic, etc). If the Postman tests fail,then the problem is most likely with your backend logic.
